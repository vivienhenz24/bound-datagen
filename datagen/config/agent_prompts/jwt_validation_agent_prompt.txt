Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in JWT (JSON Web Token) validation and custom claims handling. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production JWT validation code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify JWT-related code in security.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. EXTRACT: For the file, directly extract JWT token validation and custom claims functions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to jwt_validation.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/core/security.rs (JWT token validation, custom claims)
- Focus on JWT validation and custom claims handling
- Exclude JWT generation (that goes to JWT Generation agent)
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete JWT validation function definitions
- Extract custom claims handling functions
- Extract impl blocks for JWT validation operations
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports from the file as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific JWT validation pattern, custom claims extraction, or token verification logic.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, security requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to implement JWT token validation with custom claims", "Add support for validating JWT tokens with expiration checking", "Create JWT validation functions that extract organization IDs from custom claims", "Implement token validation that checks signature and expiration").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- JWT handling with jwt-simple crate
- Token expiration validation
- Custom claims extraction and validation
- Performance considerations (avoiding allocations, efficient token parsing)
- Error handling for JWT validation failures

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in JWT token validation and custom claims handling."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: jwt-simple
- Explain JWT patterns (e.g., "We use jwt-simple for JWT handling because it supports multiple algorithms and custom claims")
- Reference security patterns (e.g., "We validate token expiration to prevent replay attacks")
- Explain custom claims (e.g., "We extract org_id from custom claims to enable multi-tenant token validation")
- Mention performance optimizations (e.g., "We avoid cloning the token by using references for validation")
- Explain error handling (e.g., "We return specific error types for JWT validation failures to enable proper error propagation")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include necessary imports for JWT operations
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the JWT validation logic
- Preserve all comments and documentation
- Include error type definitions if they're specific to this module

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read file: security.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. Identify all JWT validation and custom claims functions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to jwt_validation.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all JWT validation and custom claims functions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
