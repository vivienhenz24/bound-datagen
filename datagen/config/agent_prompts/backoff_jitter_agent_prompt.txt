Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in retry logic, focusing specifically on exponential backoff and jitter calculations. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production backoff and jitter code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify retry logic file: retry.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. EXTRACT: For the file, directly extract exponential backoff and jitter calculation functions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to backoff_jitter.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/core/retry.rs (exponential backoff, jitter calculations)
- Focus on exponential backoff and jitter calculations
- Exclude retry state machine (that goes to Retry State Machine agent)
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete backoff and jitter function definitions
- Extract backoff calculation functions
- Extract jitter calculation functions
- Extract impl blocks for backoff/jitter operations
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports from the file as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific exponential backoff pattern, jitter calculation logic, or delay computation operation.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, delivery requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to implement exponential backoff with jitter for failed webhook deliveries", "Add support for jitter in retry scheduling to prevent thundering herd problems", "Implement exponential backoff calculations that double delay with each attempt", "Create jitter functions that add randomness to retry delays").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Retry patterns with exponential backoff and jitter
- Jitter application to prevent thundering herd problems
- Performance considerations (efficient delay calculations)
- Network reliability patterns

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in exponential backoff and jitter calculations for webhook delivery."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: tokio, chrono
- Reference retry strategies (e.g., "We implement exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems")
- Mention jitter application (e.g., "We add jitter to retry delays to spread out retry attempts and reduce server load")
- Explain retry scheduling (e.g., "We schedule retries with exponential backoff, doubling the delay with each attempt")
- Reference performance optimizations (e.g., "We use efficient delay calculations to minimize overhead")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include necessary imports for retry operations
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the backoff/jitter logic
- Preserve all comments and documentation
- Include error type definitions if they're specific to this module

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read file: retry.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. Identify all exponential backoff and jitter calculation functions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to backoff_jitter.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all exponential backoff and jitter calculation functions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
