Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in idempotency handling and request deduplication. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production idempotency code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify idempotency file: idempotency.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. EXTRACT: For the file, directly extract idempotency handling and request deduplication functions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to idempotency_handling.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/core/idempotency.rs (idempotency handling, request deduplication)
- Focus on idempotency patterns and request deduplication
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete idempotency function definitions
- Extract struct definitions for idempotency types
- Extract impl blocks for idempotency operations
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports from the file as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific idempotency pattern or request deduplication logic.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, feature requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to implement idempotency handling for API requests using request IDs", "Add support for request deduplication using cache with TTL", "Create idempotency patterns that prevent duplicate processing", "Implement idempotency handling that uses cache for request deduplication").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Idempotency patterns with request ID deduplication
- Cache-based idempotency storage
- Error handling for idempotency failures
- Performance considerations (cache usage)

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in idempotency handling and request deduplication."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: serde, chrono
- Reference idempotency (e.g., "We implement idempotency using request IDs stored in cache with TTL to prevent duplicate processing")
- Mention cache usage (e.g., "We use cache to store idempotency keys with TTL to prevent duplicate requests")
- Reference performance optimizations (e.g., "We use cache for idempotency to avoid database lookups")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include necessary imports for cache operations
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the idempotency logic
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read file: idempotency.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. Identify all idempotency handling and request deduplication functions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to idempotency_handling.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all idempotency handling and request deduplication functions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
