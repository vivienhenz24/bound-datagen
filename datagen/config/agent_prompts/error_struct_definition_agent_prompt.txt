Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in error type design, focusing specifically on Error struct definition and thiserror usage. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production Error struct definition code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify error type file: error.rs in svix-server/src/
2. EXTRACT: For the file, directly extract Error struct definition and thiserror usage - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to error_struct_definition.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/error.rs (Error struct definition, thiserror usage)
- Focus on Error struct definition and thiserror usage
- Exclude ErrorType enum (that goes to Error Type Enum agent)
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete Error struct definitions
- Extract thiserror derive macros and attributes
- Extract struct-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific Error struct definition pattern or thiserror usage.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, error handling requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need a unified error type that works across all modules with proper categorization", "Create an Error struct using thiserror for automatic error implementation", "Implement error struct definition with proper error context", "Add error struct that uses thiserror for error handling").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Error type design with thiserror crate
- Error context preservation
- Performance considerations (avoiding allocations in error paths)

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in Error struct definition and thiserror usage."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: thiserror
- Explain error type design (e.g., "We use thiserror to automatically implement Error and Display traits for our error types")
- Mention error context (e.g., "We preserve original error messages in the error chain for debugging")
- Reference performance (e.g., "We use String for error messages but avoid allocations in hot paths by using &str where possible")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include complete Error struct definitions
- Include thiserror derive macros
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read file: error.rs in svix-server/src/
2. Identify all Error struct definitions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to error_struct_definition.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all Error struct definitions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
