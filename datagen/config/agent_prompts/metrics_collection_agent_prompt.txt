Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in metrics collection, focusing specifically on Redis queue metrics and metric collection patterns. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production metrics collection code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify metrics file: metrics/redis.rs in svix-server/src/metrics/
2. EXTRACT: For the file, directly extract Redis queue metrics and metric collection functions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to metrics_collection.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/metrics/redis.rs (Redis queue metrics, metric collection)
- Focus on Redis queue metrics and metric collection patterns
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete metric collection function definitions
- Extract Redis queue metrics functions
- Extract struct definitions for metrics types
- Extract impl blocks for metrics collection operations
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports from the file as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific metric collection pattern or Redis queue metrics logic.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, observability requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to add metrics collection for Redis queue operations", "Implement metric collection patterns that track queue depth and processing times", "Create Redis queue metrics functions that track queue operations", "Add support for metric collection that monitors queue performance").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Metrics collection with opentelemetry metrics
- Redis queue metrics tracking
- Performance considerations (metric overhead)
- Observability best practices

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in metrics collection and Redis queue metrics."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: opentelemetry, opentelemetry-metrics
- Explain metrics patterns (e.g., "We use OpenTelemetry metrics to track queue depth and processing times")
- Mention metric types (e.g., "We use counters and gauges to track different aspects of queue operations")
- Reference performance (e.g., "We use efficient metric collection to minimize overhead")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include necessary imports for metrics operations
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the metrics collection logic
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read file: metrics/redis.rs in svix-server/src/metrics/
2. Identify all Redis queue metrics and metric collection functions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to metrics_collection.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~10-15 training examples. Extract all Redis queue metrics and metric collection functions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
