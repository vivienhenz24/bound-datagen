Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in Redis connection management, focusing specifically on Redis cluster and sentinel support for high availability. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production Redis HA code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify Redis HA files: cluster.rs and sentinel.rs in svix-server/src/redis/
2. EXTRACT: For the files, directly extract cluster support and sentinel support functions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to redis_ha.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/redis/cluster.rs (Redis cluster support)
- svix-server/src/redis/sentinel.rs (Redis sentinel support)
- Focus on cluster support and sentinel support
- Exclude connection pooling (that goes to Redis Connection Pool agent)
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete cluster and sentinel setup function definitions
- Extract struct definitions for cluster/sentinel types
- Extract impl blocks for cluster/sentinel operations
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific Redis cluster or sentinel setup pattern.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, Redis requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to implement Redis cluster support for high availability", "Add Redis sentinel support for automatic failover", "Create Redis cluster connection setup", "Implement Redis sentinel configuration for high availability").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Redis cluster support with redis crate cluster features
- Redis sentinel support for high availability
- Error handling for cluster/sentinel failures
- Performance considerations (cluster routing, sentinel failover)

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in Redis cluster and sentinel support for high availability."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: redis, tokio
- Explain cluster patterns (e.g., "We use Redis cluster for high availability and horizontal scaling")
- Mention sentinel patterns (e.g., "We use Redis sentinel for automatic failover when primary node fails")
- Reference performance (e.g., "Cluster routing distributes load across multiple nodes")
- Explain error handling (e.g., "We handle cluster/sentinel failures gracefully to maintain availability")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include necessary imports for Redis cluster/sentinel operations
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the HA logic
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read files: cluster.rs and sentinel.rs in svix-server/src/redis/
2. Identify all cluster and sentinel support functions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to redis_ha.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all cluster and sentinel support functions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
