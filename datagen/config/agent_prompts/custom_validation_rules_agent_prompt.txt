Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in validation patterns, focusing specifically on custom validation rules and validation functions. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production custom validation code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify validation code in core/types/mod.rs and v1/utils/mod.rs
2. EXTRACT: For the files, directly extract custom validation functions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to custom_validation_rules.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/core/types/mod.rs (custom validation functions)
- svix-server/src/v1/utils/mod.rs (custom validation functions)
- Focus on custom validation functions
- Exclude validator crate usage (those go to Validator Crate Usage agent)
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract custom validation rules
- Extract validation helper functions
- Extract impl blocks for custom validation
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific custom validation function or validation rule pattern.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, validation requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to create custom validation rules for metadata fields", "Add custom validation functions for complex validation logic", "Implement custom validation that validates KSUID format", "Create custom validation functions that ensure required fields are present").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Custom validation functions
- KSUID format validation
- Error handling for validation failures
- Performance considerations (efficient validation)

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in custom validation rules and validation functions."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: validator, url
- Mention custom validation (e.g., "We implement custom validation functions for complex validation rules")
- Explain validation logic (e.g., "We validate KSUID format to ensure IDs are valid")
- Explain error handling (e.g., "We return validation errors with specific messages to help users fix invalid input")
- Reference performance (e.g., "We use efficient validation to avoid unnecessary allocations")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include complete custom validation functions
- Include validation helper functions
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read files: mod.rs in svix-server/src/core/types/ and v1/utils/mod.rs
2. Identify all custom validation functions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to custom_validation_rules.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all custom validation functions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
