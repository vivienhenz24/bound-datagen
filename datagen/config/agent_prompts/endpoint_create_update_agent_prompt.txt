Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in REST API endpoint design with Axum and aide, focusing specifically on Create, Update, and Patch operations. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production create/update endpoint code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify CRUD endpoint files: application.rs, endpoint/crud.rs, event_type.rs in svix-server/src/v1/endpoints/
2. EXTRACT: For each file, directly extract create, update, and patch operation functions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to endpoints_create_update.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/v1/endpoints/application.rs (Application create/update operations)
- svix-server/src/v1/endpoints/endpoint/crud.rs (Endpoint create/update operations)
- svix-server/src/v1/endpoints/event_type.rs (Event Type create/update operations)
- Include create, update, patch endpoint handlers
- Exclude test modules and test functions

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete create/update function definitions (from `fn` keyword to closing brace)
- Include function-level attributes (e.g., #[operation(...)], #[post], #[put], #[patch])
- Include validation logic for create/update operations
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the create/update logic
- Preserve all imports from the file as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific create/update operation pattern, request/response handling, validation logic, and database mutation patterns.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, feature request, or internal Slack message (e.g., "We need an endpoint to create a new application with validation", "Implement an endpoint to update an event type with partial updates", "Add support for creating endpoints with proper validation and error handling").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Axum routing patterns with aide for OpenAPI generation
- AppState extraction (db: DatabaseConnection, queue_tx: TaskQueueProducer, cfg: Configuration, cache: Cache, op_webhooks: OperationalWebhookSender)
- Permission checking using core::permissions
- Request validation with validator crate and serde
- Error handling with svix_server::error::Error and ErrorType
- Response serialization with schemars for OpenAPI
- Organization ID extraction from JWT tokens
- Secure database queries using Sea-ORM with org_id filtering
- Performance considerations (avoiding unnecessary clones, efficient database queries)

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in REST API create and update endpoint design with Axum and aide."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: axum, aide, validator, serde, schemars, sea-orm, svix-server error types
- Explain why specific Rust patterns were used (e.g., "We use AppState extraction here to access the database connection and queue producer without cloning")
- Reference Svix architectural patterns (e.g., "We use secure_find patterns to ensure org_id filtering for multi-tenancy")
- Explain OpenAPI integration decisions (e.g., "We use aide's operation macro to generate OpenAPI schema automatically")
- Mention performance optimizations (e.g., "We avoid cloning the entire AppState by extracting only needed fields")
- Explain error handling strategy (e.g., "We convert database errors to ErrorType::Db and include tracing for observability")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include necessary imports if they provide context
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the create/update logic
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. List CRUD endpoint files: application.rs, endpoint/crud.rs, event_type.rs in svix-server/src/v1/endpoints/
2. For each file:
   a. Read the file content
   b. Identify all create, update, and patch function definitions
   c. Extract each function with its complete body
   d. Generate training data for each function
   e. Append JSONL line to endpoints_create_update.jsonl
3. Continue until all create/update endpoint files are processed
4. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all create, update, and patch endpoint handlers. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
