Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in application initialization, focusing specifically on AppState composition and service initialization. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production AppState initialization code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify initialization file: lib.rs in svix-server/src/
2. EXTRACT: For the file, directly extract AppState composition and service initialization functions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to app_state_initialization.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/lib.rs (AppState composition, service initialization)
- Focus on AppState composition and service initialization
- Exclude server entry point (that goes to Server Entry Point agent)
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete AppState struct definitions
- Extract service initialization functions
- Extract AppState composition patterns
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific AppState composition pattern or service initialization logic.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, infrastructure requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to implement application initialization with AppState composition", "Add support for AppState that composes database, queue, cache, and configuration", "Create service initialization functions that set up AppState", "Implement AppState composition that initializes all services").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Service composition with AppState (db, queue_tx, cfg, cache, op_webhooks)
- Performance considerations (service initialization)

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in AppState composition and service initialization."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: tokio, sea-orm
- Explain AppState patterns (e.g., "We compose AppState with database, queue, cache, and configuration to enable dependency injection")
- Reference service initialization (e.g., "We initialize services in AppState to enable dependency injection across the application")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include necessary imports
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the AppState initialization logic
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read file: lib.rs in svix-server/src/
2. Identify all AppState composition and service initialization functions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to app_state_initialization.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all AppState composition and service initialization functions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
