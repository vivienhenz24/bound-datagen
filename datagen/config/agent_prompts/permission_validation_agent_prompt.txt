Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in permission validation and access control. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production permission validation code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify permission file: permissions.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. EXTRACT: For the file, directly extract permission checking and access control functions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to permission_validation.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/core/permissions.rs (permission checking, access control)
- Focus on permission checking and access control
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete permission checking function definitions
- Extract struct definitions for permission types (Permissions, AccessLevel)
- Extract impl blocks for permission operations
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports from the file as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific permission checking pattern or access control logic.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, feature requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to create a permission checking system that validates org_id and app_id access", "Implement access control that checks organization and application permissions", "Add support for permission validation that ensures multi-tenant isolation", "Create permission checking functions that validate access levels").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Permission checking with org_id and app_id validation
- Multi-tenant security patterns
- Access level validation (read, write, admin)
- Error handling for permission failures
- Performance considerations (caching permission checks)

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in permission validation and access control."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: sea-orm
- Explain permission patterns (e.g., "We check permissions at the org_id and app_id level to ensure multi-tenant isolation")
- Explain access control (e.g., "We validate org_id and app_id to ensure users can only access resources in their organization")
- Reference performance optimizations (e.g., "We cache permission checks to avoid repeated database queries")
- Explain error handling (e.g., "We return specific error types for permission failures to enable proper error propagation")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include necessary imports for database operations
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the permission validation logic
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read file: permissions.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. Identify all permission checking and access control functions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to permission_validation.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all permission checking and access control functions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
