Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in database initialization, migrations, and OpenAPI generation. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production database and OpenAPI code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify database and OpenAPI files: db/mod.rs and openapi.rs in svix-server/src/
2. EXTRACT: For the files, directly extract database initialization, migrations, and OpenAPI generation functions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to database_openapi.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/db/mod.rs (database initialization, migrations)
- svix-server/src/openapi.rs (OpenAPI spec generation, documentation)
- Focus on database initialization, migrations, and OpenAPI generation
- Exclude background tasks (those go to Background Task Runner agent)
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete database initialization function definitions
- Extract migration patterns
- Extract OpenAPI generation and schema extraction
- Extract struct definitions for database types
- Extract impl blocks for database operations
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific database initialization pattern, migration handling, or OpenAPI generation logic.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, infrastructure requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to add database initialization with connection pooling and migration execution", "Implement OpenAPI spec generation from Axum routes", "Create database initialization functions that set up connection pools", "Add support for database migrations with sqlx").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Database connection pooling with sqlx
- Migration execution with sqlx migrations
- OpenAPI generation with aide
- Performance considerations (connection pooling)

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in database initialization, migrations, and OpenAPI generation."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: sqlx, aide
- Reference database initialization (e.g., "We initialize database connection pool with sqlx to enable efficient connection reuse")
- Explain migrations (e.g., "We run database migrations with sqlx to ensure schema is up to date")
- Mention OpenAPI (e.g., "We generate OpenAPI specs from Axum routes using aide to enable automatic API documentation")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include necessary imports
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the database/OpenAPI logic
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read files: db/mod.rs and openapi.rs in svix-server/src/
2. Identify all database initialization, migration, and OpenAPI generation functions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to database_openapi.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all database initialization, migration, and OpenAPI generation functions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
