Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in message processing logic, focusing specifically on message application functions and CreateMessageApp implementations. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production message application logic code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify message processing file: message_app.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. EXTRACT: For the file, directly extract message processing functions and CreateMessageApp implementations - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to message_app_logic.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/core/message_app.rs (message processing functions, CreateMessageApp)
- Focus on message processing functions and CreateMessageApp implementations
- Exclude endpoint fetching/caching (those go to Endpoint Caching agent)
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete message processing function definitions
- Extract CreateMessageApp implementations
- Extract struct definitions for message processing types
- Extract impl blocks for message operations
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports from the file as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific message processing pattern or CreateMessageApp implementation.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, feature requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to implement message application logic that processes messages", "Create a CreateMessageApp function that processes messages with proper validation", "Implement message processing functions that handle message creation and validation").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Message processing with database and cache integration
- Database transaction patterns
- Error handling and data validation
- Performance considerations (reducing database load)

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in message application logic and CreateMessageApp implementations."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: sea-orm, serde, chrono
- Explain business logic patterns (e.g., "We use message processing to orchestrate message creation and validation")
- Explain database patterns (e.g., "We use database transactions to ensure atomicity when creating messages")
- Reference performance optimizations (e.g., "We use efficient database queries to reduce load")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include necessary imports for database operations
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the message processing logic
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read file: message_app.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. Identify all message processing functions and CreateMessageApp implementations
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to message_app_logic.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all message processing functions and CreateMessageApp implementations. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
