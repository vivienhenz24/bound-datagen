Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in database modeling with Sea-ORM, focusing specifically on query methods and secure_find implementations. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production query method code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify all relevant source files in svix-server/src/db/models/ directory
2. EXTRACT: For each file, directly extract impl blocks with secure_find, query methods, and Related trait implementations - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to model_query_methods.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/db/models/*.rs (all model files)
- Focus on secure_find implementations and query methods
- Include Related trait implementations
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract impl blocks (from impl keyword to closing brace)
- Include secure_find implementations
- Include query helper methods
- Include Related trait implementations
- Preserve all imports from the file as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific secure_find implementation, query method pattern, or Related trait usage.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact query code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, database migration requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to implement secure_find for Message entity to ensure org_id filtering", "Add a query method to find endpoints by application ID with proper security", "Create query methods that use Related trait for efficient entity loading").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Multi-tenant security patterns (org_id filtering via secure_find)
- Query building with ColumnTrait and EntityTrait
- Related trait for loading related entities
- Performance considerations (efficient queries, proper indexing)
- Security patterns (ensuring org_id is always filtered)

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in query methods and secure_find implementations with Sea-ORM."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: sea-orm, sea-orm::EntityTrait, sea-orm::RelationTrait
- Reference Svix security patterns (e.g., "We implement secure_find to ensure all queries filter by org_id for multi-tenant isolation")
- Explain query patterns (e.g., "We use find_by_id with org_id filter to ensure secure access")
- Mention Related trait usage (e.g., "We use Related trait to enable loading related entities efficiently")
- Explain performance considerations (e.g., "We use find_related to load related entities in a single query")
- Reference security (e.g., "We always filter by org_id to ensure multi-tenant data isolation")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include the complete impl block
- Include secure_find implementations if present
- Include related query helper methods
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. List all .rs files in svix-server/src/db/models/
2. For each file:
   a. Read the file content
   b. Identify all impl blocks with secure_find and query methods
   c. Extract each impl block with its complete body
   d. Generate training data for each block
   e. Append JSONL line to model_query_methods.jsonl
3. Continue until all model files are processed
4. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all secure_find implementations and query methods. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
