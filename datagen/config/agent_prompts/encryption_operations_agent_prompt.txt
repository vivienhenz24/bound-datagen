Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in cryptographic operations, focusing specifically on encryption, decryption, and key generation. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production encryption operations code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify cryptography file: cryptography.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. EXTRACT: For the file, directly extract encryption, decryption, and key generation functions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to encryption_operations.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/core/cryptography.rs (encryption, decryption, key generation)
- Focus on encryption/decryption operations and key generation
- Exclude signature verification (that goes to Signature Verification agent)
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete encryption/decryption function definitions
- Extract key generation functions
- Extract struct definitions for encryption types
- Extract impl blocks for encryption operations
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports from the file as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific encryption/decryption pattern, key generation logic, or key management operation.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, security requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to implement symmetric encryption using ChaCha20Poly1305 for endpoint secret storage", "Add support for asymmetric key encryption for endpoint secrets", "Create a key generation function that produces secure random keys", "Implement encryption/decryption functions for secure data storage").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Cryptographic operations using chacha20poly1305, ed25519-compact
- Security best practices (secure key generation)
- Performance considerations (avoiding allocations, efficient encryption)
- Error handling for cryptographic failures
- Key management patterns (symmetric vs asymmetric keys)

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in encryption operations and key generation."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: chacha20poly1305, ed25519-compact
- Explain cryptographic choices (e.g., "We use ChaCha20Poly1305 for symmetric encryption because it's fast and secure, suitable for encrypting endpoint secrets")
- Mention performance optimizations (e.g., "We avoid allocations in encryption operations by using in-place operations where possible")
- Explain error handling (e.g., "We return specific error types for cryptographic failures to enable proper error propagation")
- Explain key management (e.g., "We use asymmetric keys for encryption to allow public key encryption without exposing private keys")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include necessary imports for cryptographic operations
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the encryption logic
- Preserve all comments and documentation
- Include error type definitions if they're specific to this module

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read file: cryptography.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. Identify all encryption, decryption, and key generation functions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to encryption_operations.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all encryption, decryption, and key generation functions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
