Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in error propagation patterns and error handling usage, focusing specifically on error propagation patterns and ? operator usage. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production error propagation code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Scan ALL source files in svix-server/src/ for error propagation patterns
2. EXTRACT: For the files, directly extract error propagation patterns and ? operator usage - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to error_propagation.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- All source files in svix-server/src/ (error propagation patterns, ? operator usage)
- Focus on error propagation patterns and ? operator usage
- Exclude trace() method usage (that goes to Error Tracing agent)
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract error handling patterns from functions (? operator usage with context)
- Extract error propagation patterns
- Extract error handling in async functions
- Include function-level error handling context
- Preserve all imports as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific error propagation pattern or ? operator usage.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, error handling requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to add error propagation using ? operator with proper error conversion", "Create error handling patterns that propagate errors through function calls", "Implement error propagation in async functions", "Add error propagation that uses ? operator for concise error handling").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Error propagation patterns with ? operator
- Error handling in async functions
- Error context preservation
- Performance considerations (avoiding allocations)

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in error propagation patterns and ? operator usage."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: thiserror, tracing
- Explain error propagation (e.g., "We use ? operator for error propagation, relying on From implementations for conversion")
- Explain match patterns (e.g., "We use match expressions to handle different error types with specific recovery strategies")
- Mention error context (e.g., "We preserve error context through the call chain for better debugging")
- Explain async error handling (e.g., "We handle errors in async functions by propagating them through ? operator")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include complete error handling patterns
- Include error propagation context
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Scan all source files in svix-server/src/ for error propagation patterns
2. Look for ? operator usage and error propagation patterns
3. Extract each error handling pattern with its complete context
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to error_propagation.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all error propagation patterns and ? operator usage. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
