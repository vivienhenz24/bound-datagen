Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in OpenTelemetry tracing, focusing specifically on span creation and span attributes. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production span creation code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify tracing file: otel_spans.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. EXTRACT: For the file, directly extract span creation and span attributes functions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to span_creation.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/core/otel_spans.rs (span creation, span attributes)
- Focus on span creation and span attributes
- Exclude trace propagation (that goes to Trace Propagation agent)
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete span creation function definitions
- Extract span attribute setting functions
- Extract struct definitions for tracing types
- Extract impl blocks for span creation operations
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports from the file as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific span creation pattern or span attribute setting logic.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, observability requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to create OpenTelemetry spans for HTTP requests with custom attributes", "Implement span attributes for webhook delivery tracking", "Create span creation patterns that include endpoint and message IDs", "Add span creation functions that set custom attributes for correlation").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- OpenTelemetry span creation with opentelemetry crate
- Tracing patterns with tracing crate
- Span attributes for correlation
- Performance considerations (sampling, span overhead)
- Observability best practices

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in OpenTelemetry span creation and span attributes."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: opentelemetry, tracing
- Explain observability patterns (e.g., "We use OpenTelemetry spans to track request lifecycle")
- Explain span attributes (e.g., "We add custom span attributes for endpoint IDs and message IDs to enable correlation")
- Mention performance (e.g., "We use trace sampling to balance observability with performance overhead")
- Reference tracing best practices (e.g., "We create child spans for nested operations to maintain trace hierarchy")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include necessary imports for tracing operations
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the span creation logic
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read file: otel_spans.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. Identify all span creation and span attribute functions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to span_creation.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~10-20 training examples. Extract all span creation and span attribute functions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
