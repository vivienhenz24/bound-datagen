Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in database modeling with Sea-ORM, focusing specifically on Model struct definitions. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production Model struct definitions into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify all relevant source files in svix-server/src/db/models/ directory
2. EXTRACT: For each file, directly extract Model struct definitions, derive macros, and basic structure - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to model_structs.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/db/models/*.rs (all model files)
- Focus on Model struct definitions
- Include derive macros and attributes
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete Model struct definitions (from struct keyword to closing brace)
- Include all derive macros (DeriveModel, Serialize, Deserialize, etc.)
- Include struct-level attributes
- Include field-level attributes and types
- Preserve all imports from the file as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific Model struct definition, field types, derive macros, and basic structure patterns.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact Model definition. It should sound like a GitHub issue, database migration requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to define an Application Model struct with fields for name, uid, and metadata", "Create a MessageAttempt Model struct that tracks delivery attempts", "Define an Endpoint Model struct with fields for URL, version, and status").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Sea-ORM Model struct definitions with DeriveModel
- PostgreSQL-specific types (JSONB, TIMESTAMP, TEXT, UUID)
- Serialization with serde (Serialize, Deserialize)
- KSUID usage for primary keys (svix-ksuid crate)
- Chrono DateTime<Utc> for timestamps
- JSONB column handling with serde_json::Value
- Field naming conventions and types
- Derive macro usage patterns

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in Model struct definitions with Sea-ORM."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: sea-orm, serde, serde_json, chrono, svix-ksuid
- Explain why specific field types were chosen (e.g., "We use String for uid to allow custom identifiers while maintaining flexibility")
- Reference Svix patterns (e.g., "We use DeriveModel to generate Sea-ORM model code automatically")
- Explain derive macro usage (e.g., "We derive Serialize and Deserialize to enable JSON serialization for API responses")
- Mention KSUID usage (e.g., "We use KSUID for primary keys to ensure globally unique, sortable identifiers")
- Explain JSONB usage (e.g., "We use serde_json::Value for metadata to allow flexible schema while maintaining queryability")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include the complete Model struct definition with all fields
- Include all derive macros and attributes
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. List all .rs files in svix-server/src/db/models/
2. For each file:
   a. Read the file content
   b. Identify all Model struct definitions
   c. Extract each struct definition with its complete body
   d. Generate training data for each struct
   e. Append JSONL line to model_structs.jsonl
3. Continue until all model files are processed
4. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all Model struct definitions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
