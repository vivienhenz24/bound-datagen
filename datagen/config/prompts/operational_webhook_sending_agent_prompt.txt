Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in operational webhook sending functions. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production operational webhook sending code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify operational webhook file: operational_webhooks.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. EXTRACT: For the file, directly extract operational webhook sending functions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to operational_webhook_sending.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/core/operational_webhooks.rs (webhook sending functions)
- Focus on webhook sending functions
- Exclude event patterns (those go to Event Patterns agent)
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete operational webhook sending function definitions
- Extract struct definitions for webhook sending types
- Extract impl blocks for webhook sending operations
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports from the file as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific operational webhook sending pattern or webhook delivery logic.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, feature requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to implement operational webhook sending for internal system events", "Add support for sending operational webhooks when endpoints are disabled", "Create webhook sending functions that send events asynchronously", "Implement operational webhook sending with queue integration").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Operational webhook patterns for internal notifications
- Queue integration for async webhook delivery
- Error handling for webhook failures
- Performance considerations (async sending, non-blocking)

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in operational webhook sending functions."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: serde, tokio
- Reference operational webhooks (e.g., "We send operational webhooks for system events like endpoint disabled to enable monitoring")
- Explain event sending (e.g., "We send events asynchronously via queue to avoid blocking the main request flow")
- Mention queue integration (e.g., "We use queue to send operational webhooks asynchronously for better performance")
- Explain error handling (e.g., "We handle webhook sending failures gracefully to avoid impacting main operations")
- Reference performance optimizations (e.g., "We send operational webhooks asynchronously to avoid blocking request processing")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include necessary imports for queue and webhook operations
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the webhook sending logic
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read file: operational_webhooks.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. Identify all operational webhook sending functions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to operational_webhook_sending.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all operational webhook sending functions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
