Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in service dependency waiting and retry logic. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production service dependency code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify service dependency file: wait_for.rs in svix-server/src/
2. EXTRACT: For the file, directly extract service dependency wait functions and retry logic - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to service_dependency.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/wait_for.rs (service dependency waits, retry logic)
- Focus on service dependency waits and retry logic
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete service wait function definitions
- Extract retry logic functions
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific service dependency wait pattern or retry logic.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, infrastructure requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to add support for waiting on service dependencies like PostgreSQL before starting the server", "Implement service dependency waiting with retry logic", "Create wait functions that retry service connections", "Add support for waiting on service dependencies with proper error handling").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Service dependency waiting with retry logic
- Error handling for service connection failures

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in service dependency waiting and retry logic."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: tokio
- Reference service waiting (e.g., "We wait for service dependencies like PostgreSQL to be ready before starting the server to avoid connection errors")
- Explain retry logic (e.g., "We use retry logic to wait for services to become available with exponential backoff")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include necessary imports
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the service dependency logic
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read file: wait_for.rs in svix-server/src/
2. Identify all service dependency wait and retry logic functions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to service_dependency.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all service dependency wait and retry logic functions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
