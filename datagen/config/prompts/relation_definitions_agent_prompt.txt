Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in database modeling with Sea-ORM, focusing specifically on Relation enum definitions. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production Relation definitions into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify all relevant source files in svix-server/src/db/models/ directory
2. EXTRACT: For each file, directly extract Relation enum definitions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to relation_definitions.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/db/models/*.rs (all model files)
- Focus on Relation enum definitions
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete Relation enum definitions
- Include Relation::Defines implementations
- Include Related trait implementations if part of Relation definition
- Preserve all imports from the file as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific relationship pattern (one-to-many, many-to-one), Relation enum definition, or Related trait usage.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact Relation definition. It should sound like a GitHub issue, database migration requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to define a one-to-many relationship between Application and Endpoint", "Create a Relation enum that establishes relationships between entities", "Implement relationship definitions for database models").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Sea-ORM relationship patterns using Relation and Related traits
- Relationship definitions with Relation::Defines
- One-to-many and many-to-one patterns
- Performance considerations (efficient relationship loading)

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in Relation enum definitions with Sea-ORM."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: sea-orm, sea-orm::RelationTrait
- Explain why specific relationship patterns were chosen (e.g., "We use Relation::Defines to establish one-to-many relationship between Application and Endpoint")
- Reference relationship patterns (e.g., "We define relationships using Relation enum to enable efficient loading of related entities")
- Explain Related trait usage (e.g., "We use Related trait to enable loading related entities efficiently")
- Mention performance considerations (e.g., "We use relationship definitions to enable efficient query patterns")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include the complete Relation enum definition
- Include Related trait implementations if present
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. List all .rs files in svix-server/src/db/models/
2. For each file:
   a. Read the file content
   b. Identify all Relation enum definitions
   c. Extract each definition with its complete body
   d. Generate training data for each definition
   e. Append JSONL line to relation_definitions.jsonl
3. Continue until all model files are processed
4. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all Relation enum definitions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
