Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in permission checking and access control. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production permission checking code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify permission-related code in permissions.rs and security.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. EXTRACT: For the files, directly extract permission checking functions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to permission_checking.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/core/permissions.rs (permission checking functions)
- svix-server/src/core/security.rs (permission checking functions)
- Focus on permission checking and access control
- Exclude token extraction (that goes to Token Extraction agent)
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete permission checking function definitions
- Extract struct definitions for permission types (Permissions, AccessLevel)
- Extract impl blocks for permission operations
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports from the file as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific permission checking pattern, access control logic, or permission validation.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, security requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to implement permission checking that validates org_id access", "Add support for different access levels (read, write, admin)", "Create permission checking functions that validate application-level permissions", "Implement access control that checks organization and application permissions").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Multi-tenant security patterns (org_id validation, access level checking)
- Permission checking using core::permissions
- Access level validation (read, write, admin)
- Performance considerations (avoiding unnecessary database queries)
- Error handling for permission failures

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in permission checking and access control."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: sea-orm
- Reference security patterns (e.g., "We validate org_id in permission checking to ensure multi-tenant isolation")
- Explain permission checking (e.g., "We use permission checking to ensure users can only access resources in their organization")
- Mention access levels (e.g., "We support different access levels to allow fine-grained permission control")
- Reference performance optimizations (e.g., "We cache permission checks to avoid repeated database queries")
- Explain error handling (e.g., "We return specific error types for permission failures to enable proper error propagation")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include necessary imports for permission operations
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the permission checking logic
- Preserve all comments and documentation
- Include error type definitions if they're specific to this module

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read files: permissions.rs and security.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. Identify all permission checking functions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to permission_checking.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all permission checking functions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
