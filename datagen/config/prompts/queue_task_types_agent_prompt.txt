Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in message queue task type definitions. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production queue task type code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify queue abstraction file: mod.rs in svix-server/src/queue/
2. EXTRACT: For the file, directly extract QueueTask enum and task type definitions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to queue_task_types.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/queue/mod.rs (QueueTask enum, task type definitions)
- Focus on QueueTask enum and task type definitions (MessageTask, MessageTaskBatch)
- Exclude queue traits (those go to Queue Traits agent)
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract QueueTask enum definitions
- Extract MessageTask and MessageTaskBatch struct definitions
- Extract task type helper methods
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific queue task type definition or task type pattern.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, queue requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to implement a QueueTask enum that supports different message types", "Create MessageTask and MessageTaskBatch types for queue operations", "Add task type definitions that support different queue operations", "Implement task types with proper serialization").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Queue task type definitions with serde serialization
- Task type patterns for different operations
- Performance considerations (efficient serialization)

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in queue task type definitions."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: serde
- Explain task type patterns (e.g., "We use an enum for QueueTask to support different message types while maintaining type safety")
- Mention serialization (e.g., "We use serde for task serialization to enable JSON-based queue operations")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include complete task type definitions
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read file: mod.rs in svix-server/src/queue/
2. Identify all QueueTask enum and task type definitions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to queue_task_types.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all QueueTask enum and task type definitions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
