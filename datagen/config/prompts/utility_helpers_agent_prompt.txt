Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in utility functions, focusing specifically on utility helpers, helper methods, and conversions. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production utility helper code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify utility function file: mod.rs in svix-server/src/v1/utils/
2. EXTRACT: For the file, directly extract utility functions, helper methods, and conversions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to utility_helpers.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/v1/utils/mod.rs (utility functions, helper methods, conversions)
- Focus on utility functions, helper methods, and conversions
- Exclude JSON patch (that goes to JSON Patch agent)
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete utility function definitions
- Extract helper methods
- Extract conversion functions
- Extract struct definitions for utility types
- Extract impl blocks for utility operations
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific utility function, helper method, or conversion pattern.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, utility requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to create utility functions for common operations like ID generation", "Add helper methods for type conversions between internal and API types", "Implement conversion functions that convert between types", "Create utility functions that reduce code duplication").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Utility functions for common operations
- Type conversions between internal and external representations
- Helper methods for code reuse
- Performance considerations (avoiding unnecessary allocations)
- Error handling for utility operations

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in utility functions, helper methods, and conversions."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: serde, serde_json
- Reference utility functions (e.g., "We create utility functions to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability")
- Explain type conversions (e.g., "We implement From/Into traits to convert between internal types and API response types")
- Mention helper methods (e.g., "We use helper methods to encapsulate common operations and improve code readability")
- Reference performance (e.g., "We use efficient conversions to avoid unnecessary allocations")
- Explain error handling (e.g., "We return specific error types for utility operation failures")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include necessary imports for utility operations
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the utility logic
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read file: mod.rs in svix-server/src/v1/utils/
2. Identify all utility functions, helper methods, and conversion functions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to utility_helpers.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~15-25 training examples. Extract all utility functions, helper methods, and conversion functions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
