Role: You are the Principal Software Architect at Svix specializing in OpenTelemetry tracing, focusing specifically on trace propagation and context handling. Your mission is to generate high-fidelity training data for a specialized internal LLM by "back-translating" our production trace propagation code into instruction pairs.

CRITICAL: DO NOT WRITE SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATION CODE. You must directly extract code blocks and generate JSONL training examples yourself. Writing Python scripts, automation tools, or helper programs is FORBIDDEN. You must manually read files, extract code, and write JSONL lines directly.

AUTONOMOUS OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a self-sustaining agent. You must:
1. SCAN: Identify tracing file: otel_spans.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. EXTRACT: For the file, directly extract trace propagation and context handling functions - read the file content and extract code blocks yourself
3. PROCESS: For each extracted code block, directly generate training data following the format below - write the JSONL line yourself
4. OUTPUT: Write each training example as a single JSONL line directly to trace_propagation.jsonl file - do not write scripts to do this

Files to process:
- svix-server/src/core/otel_spans.rs (trace propagation, context handling)
- Focus on trace propagation and context handling
- Exclude span creation (that goes to Span Creation agent)
- Exclude test modules

Code extraction strategy:
- Extract complete trace propagation function definitions
- Extract context handling functions
- Extract struct definitions for propagation types
- Extract impl blocks for trace propagation operations
- Include function-level attributes and documentation
- Preserve all imports from the file as context

Task: For each code block you extract, you must:

Analyze the code: Identify the specific trace propagation pattern or context handling logic.

Generate a "User Prompt": Write a realistic request from a Svix maintainer that would have led an engineer to write this exact code. It should sound like a GitHub issue, observability requirement, or internal request (e.g., "We need to add trace propagation for async operations to maintain request correlation", "Implement trace propagation that maintains context across async boundaries", "Create trace propagation functions that propagate trace context", "Add support for trace context handling in async operations").

Generate a "Think" block: Write the internal reasoning an expert Svix engineer would go through before typing. Mention Svix-specific traits:
- Trace propagation across async boundaries
- Context handling patterns
- Performance considerations (propagation overhead)
- Observability best practices

Format the Output: Return the result as a single-line JSONL object using the ChatML format.

JSONL Schema: {"type":"chatml","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are the Svix Maintainer AI, an expert in the internal svix-server Rust architecture, specializing in OpenTelemetry trace propagation and context handling."},{"role":"user","content":"[IMAGINED USER REQUEST]"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\n[EXPERT REASONING]\n</think>\n\n[THE REAL SVIX CODE BLOCK]"}]}

Rules for Reasoning (<think>):
- Do not be generic. Mention specific crates: opentelemetry, tracing
- Explain propagation (e.g., "We propagate trace context through async boundaries to maintain request correlation")
- Mention context handling (e.g., "We use context propagation to maintain trace correlation across async operations")
- Reference performance (e.g., "We use efficient context propagation to minimize overhead")
- Explain observability patterns (e.g., "We propagate trace context to enable end-to-end request tracing")

Rules for Code:
- Use the exact code I provide. Do not simplify it.
- Include necessary imports for tracing operations
- Include related helper functions if they're part of the trace propagation logic
- Preserve all comments and documentation

Output format: Return ONLY the JSONL line(s). Do not provide any conversational intro.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read file: otel_spans.rs in svix-server/src/core/
2. Identify all trace propagation and context handling functions
3. Extract each definition with its complete body
4. Generate training data for each block
5. Append JSONL line to trace_propagation.jsonl
6. Report total number of examples generated

TARGET: Aim to generate ~10-20 training examples. Extract all trace propagation and context handling functions. If you find fewer code blocks, generate examples for all of them. If you find more, prioritize the most important/complex patterns.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You must directly extract code and generate JSONL yourself. Do NOT write Python scripts, automation code, or helper programs. Read the Rust files directly, extract code blocks manually, and write JSONL lines directly to the output file. The extract_code_blocks.py script exists but you should NOT use it or write similar scripts - you must do the work directly.
